# TheiaECS - Benchmark of Archetype-based ECSs (C#)

This benchmark evaluates various frameworks that are based on **archetypes**, which define a unique combination of component types for an entity. Archetypes serve as unique identifiers for entities that share the same component types within a world.

### Frameworks Benchmarked

- **[Theia ECS](https://github.com/vrezendedev/TheiaECS)**
- **[Arch](https://github.com/genaray/Arch)**  
- **[Friflo](https://github.com/friflo/Friflo.Engine.ECS)**  
- **[Fennecs](https://github.com/outfox/fennecs/)**  

---

## 📌 Key Considerations:
- **Core Libraries Only**: The benchmarks focus on core libraries, excluding "extended" libraries that may enhance performance.
- **Bulk Operations**: Bulked operations were **not** considered in these tests, ensuring that the results reflect only the core operations.

## ⚠️ Warning

The current version of this benchmark is using a **.dll** for **TheiaECS**. In future updates, this will be replaced with the official **NuGet package** for easier integration and improved flexibility.
